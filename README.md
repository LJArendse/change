## objective
The aim of this project is to create a game domain which is centered around human-ai team collaboration.
In other words, creating a problem solving collaborative game environment where:
- there is a shared global goal between the human and agent.
- the domain should enforce collaboration between the human and ai agent, thus ensuring collaboration over optional cooperation
- regarding the problem solving effort, the human player is the leader and the ai agent is the companion assistant
  - i.e. whilst the human is hypothesizing and leading the problem solving effort, how should the companion agent assist and help? 

## technology
We are thinking of using the Unity ML toolkit and the Unity ML python API, in some way to build out the game and enable agent creation.
